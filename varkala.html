        <h1>Varkala: Get Set for a Tempting Vacation!</h1>
        <p>Keen on vacationing on an unspoilt beach in Gods own country, Kerala? Give the crowded, popular beach

            places to visit in Varkala. This tranquil location brings a sense of peace to both devotees and vacationers.
            The golden beach and the azure Arabian Sea beside it offer a relaxing environment. The cliff overlooking the
            beach is covered in lush greenery. The riot of colours with the green foliage, the golden sands and the blue
            sea is a dream for photographers. Varkala beach is not the only attraction here. The history of Varkala
            dates back to 2000 years ago when the Janardhana Swamy Temple was built. The water from the natural spring
            here has medicinal properties while the sea offers the chance to swim and surf. The hanging cliff is just
            right for paragliding too. With interesting options for varied activities, the places to visit in Varkala
            offer a tempting vacation.</p>
        <h1>When to Visit Varkala?</h1>
        <p>The best time to visit Varkala is said to be the winter season. The coastal town has a dry atmosphere with
            Varkala temperature ranging between 12 and 31 degrees. Monsoon time is the shoulder season where places to
            visit in Varkala receive heavy rainfall. But the surrounding turns vibrant green and is apt for photography.
            Varkala temperature soars as high as 40 degrees during the summer months. This is the off-season for tourism
            since Varkala weather and hence budget friendly. If you really want to visit in the off-season, March will
            be the best time to visit Varkala as it hosts the Arattu and Kaliyoot festivals.</p>
        <h1>How to Reach Varakala?</h1>

            thoran (spicy curry). An interesting take on the dosa pancake is the small and thick Tata dosa. You can
            enquire about Varkala food and places to eat from locals or the guide taking you around the places to visit
            in Varkala. Also, sample the differently flavoured coffees at popular joints. </p>
